# CGD Report - The New Economy of Africa: Opportunities for Nigeria’s Emerging Technology Sector

Nigeria has a vibrant tech sector—but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to be a tech entrepreneur. 
The Center for Global Development carried out a survey of Nigerian tech firms in the fall of 2018 that gathered data on the challenges and opportunities for the tech sector. We based the the survey tool was based on the World Bank Enterprise Survey which is a standard data collection mechanism for businesses around the world.

For this report I created various charts in R using ggplot2. We used the data from our Nigeria survey along with data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. We compare the responses of Nigerian tech businesses to the service industry as a whole in Nigeria. We also compare with the service sector of South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana.
