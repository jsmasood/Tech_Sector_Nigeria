# CGD Report - The New Economy of Africa: Opportunities for Nigeria’s Emerging Technology Sector
Center for Global Development

Nigeria has a vibrant tech sector—but that doesn’t mean it’s easy to be a tech entrepreneur. 
The ONE Campaign and the Center for Global Development carried out a survey of Nigerian tech firms in the fall of 2018 that gathered data on the challenges and opportunities for the tech sector.

The report can be found here - https://www.cgdev.org/reader/new-economy-africa-opportunities-nigerias-emerging-technology-sector?page=0

For this report I created various charts in R using ggplot2. We used the data from our Nigeria survey along with data from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys. We compare the responses of Nigerian tech businesses to the service industry as a whole in Nigeria. We also compare with the service sector of South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Ghana.
